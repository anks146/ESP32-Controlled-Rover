# ESP32-Controlled-Rover
A rover designed for being controlled using an ESP32 connected to a mobile phone. 
This rover is based on STM32H743ZI2 Nucleo Board which is connected to an ESP32 via UART connection. The user connects to the ESP32 Wi-Fi network via
a mobile/laptop, it can give instructions to the rover to move forward/backword/left or right. The ESP32 will then send the corresponding
instructions to the STM32 via the UART interface and the STM32H743 will do the needful.
This project was a part of my internship project and was completed implemented and successfully tested for all the relevant criterias 
pertaining to the same.
